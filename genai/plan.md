# GenAI Learning Plan

The overall goal is to learn how to implement models in GenAI with a goal of understanding how it can be used in conjunction with an application towards detecting icy bridges.  When we were doing the initial work with AWS Recognition and Mxnet, we had difficulty in training data to detect bridge seams which I considered an important ablitly.   We could not even identify bridges with certainity.  Due to the advancement of genAI and LLM I wanted to learn about this technology and if it could be utilized towards our goal of detecting icy bridges.

## General purpose genAI theory

There exists somem free (low cost) classes available.  These classes are openAI ChatGPT focused but the material applies to both the GCP and AWS implementation of microservices.  In order to learn the fundamentals before the implementation details of the various cloud providers, this is a good starting point and more easily accessible to everyone.

Classes of interest (in order of increasing difficulty) are:

* Datacamp: Intro to ChatGPT - completed 20230813
* Datacamp: webinar - completed 20230819
* Datacamp: ai fundamentals track - todo

## openAI.com (ChatGPT) specific implementation

I haven't fully investiated these classes yet, but here is a starter


* Datacamp: openAI API course - todo
* DeepLearning.ai: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering course - todo


## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) specific implementation

I haven't fully investiated these classes yet, but here is a starter


* GCP GenAI learning path

## Amazon Web Services (AWS) specific implementation

I haven't fully investiated these classes yet, but here is a starter

* AWS/DeepLearning AI class
